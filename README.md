# Organization-and-annotation-of-Eukaryote-genomes-course

## Repository Overview
This GitHub repository is designated for the project that is a part of the Organization and annotation of Eukaryote genomes course from the University of Bern. The project focuses on comprehensive eukaryotic genome annotation and comparative genomics, covering transposable element annotation, gene annotation, and orthology-based functional annotation with genome comparisons of *Arabidopsis thaliana* genomic (Nov-02) sample.

## Dataset Description
The dataset utilized for this project was obtained from Lian et al. (2024). The SRA accession for the **Nov-02** DNA sequencing reads is **ERR11437321**, which originates from the Asia region, and the SRA accession for the **Sha** RNA-seq reads is **ERR754081**.
